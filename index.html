        <h1>Welcome to your next holiday!</h1>
        <p>
          Getting to Kayangan Lake itself involves quite a few steps, but it is
          with confidence that the entire journey will be worth it once you see
          this breathtaking body of water and its picturesque surroundings.
          First, you need to reach Coron. Coming from Manila, take a flight to
          Busuanga Airport. Upon arrival, you will then ride a shuttle van to
          get to Coron Town proper. Coron is also accessible via sea travel,
          with ferry trips coming from Manila.
        </p>
        <p>
          The town of Coron is where most resorts, hotels, and restaurants are
          located, and the jumpoff point to reach Kayangan Lake, which is
          located in Coron Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid confusion, Coron town is different from Coron Island. The
          former is part of Busuanga Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Coron Town, you will then need to sign up to join a Coron Island
          group tour or rent a private boat to take you to Kayangan Lake. Most
          of these tours take you to several tourist attractions around Coron
          Island including other majestic lakes, idyllic islands, and stunning
          lagoons with waters abundant with marine life.
